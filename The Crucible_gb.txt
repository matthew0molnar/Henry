The Crucible

    Hard ye may be in the tumult,
      Red to your battle hilts,
    Blow give for blow in the foray,
      Cunningly ride in the tilts;
    But when the roaring is ended
      Tenderly, unbeguiled,
    Turn to a woman a woman's
      Heart, and a child's to a child.

    Test of the man, if his worth be
      In accord with the ultimate plan,
    That he be not, to his marring,
      Always and utterly man;
    That he bring out of the tumult,
      Fitter and undefiled,
    To a woman the heart of a woman,
      To children the heart of a child.

    Good when the bugles are ranting
      It is to be iron and fire;
    Good to be oak in the foray,
      Ice to a guilty desire.
    But when the battle is over
      (Marvel and wonder the while)
    Give to a woman a woman's
      Heart, and a child's to a child.
